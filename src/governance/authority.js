/**
 * Authority scoring (GAP-18).
 *
 * Score formula (configurable weights, defaults below):
 *   authority = (confidence × 0.35) + (recency × 0.25) + (access_frequency × 0.20) + (role × 0.20)
 *
 * where:
 *   confidence       = stored confidence score (0–1)
 *   recency          = exp(-AGE_DECAY × days_since_created)
 *   access_frequency = log1p(access_count) / 10   (capped contribution)
 *   role             = ROLE_SCORES[author_role] ?? 0.50
 *
 * Role gate: an engineer-authored entry can NEVER auto-supersede an
 * architect or principal_architect entry — always routes to human review.
 * This is a hard check, applied before the score delta comparison.
 *
 * Role-based confidence floor (v0.2):
 *   When a caller-provided confidence is below the role's base_confidence floor,
 *   the floor is used instead. Spoofing is architecturally impossible — author
 *   is resolved server-side, never accepted from tool input.
 *
 * Business roles (added alongside engineering roles):
 *   product_owner      — authority over product requirements and feature decisions
 *   business_analyst   — captures and refines business requirements
 *   compliance_officer — authority over compliance and regulatory constraints
